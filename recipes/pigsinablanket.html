    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Here's the real talk: You're simply not having a party if you don't make pigs in a blanket. Whether you're having people 
    over for an ugly sweater party, a family game night or a Super Bowl celebration, this classic party appetizer is a necessity.</p>
    <p>We can't get enough of them, and when they're SO easy to make, there's no reason not to!</p>
