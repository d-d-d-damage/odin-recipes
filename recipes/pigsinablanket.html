    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Here's the real talk: You're simply not having a party if you don't make pigs in a blanket. Whether you're having people 
    over for an ugly sweater party, a family game night or a Super Bowl celebration, this classic party appetizer is a necessity.</p>
    <p>We can't get enough of them, and when they're SO easy to make, there's no reason not to!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8-oz.) tube crescent rolls</li>
        <li>1 12-oz. package mini cocktail weiners</li>
        <li>4 tbsp. melted butter</li>
        <li>Coarse salt, for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375ยบ. On a lightly floured surface, 
        unroll crescent sheets and tear where perforated. Cut each triangle into 3 smaller triangles.</li>
        <li>Place one cocktail weiner on thick side of each triangle then gently roll to thinner side.</li>
        <li>Try to stay composed.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a medium baking sheet, brush with melted butter, and a sprinkle with coarse salt.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
