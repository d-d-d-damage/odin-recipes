    <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../images/macandcheese.jpeg" alt="Macoroni and Cheese">
    <p>Baked mac and cheese.  It’s nearly the universal comfort food, and there are SO many variations!  
        In fact, I almost didn’t post this recipe, as there are SOOOO many mac and cheese recipes available, 
        and most people already have their favorite way of making it.</p>
    <p>Of course, there’s no “right” way or “wrong” way, so I’m here sharing the way I like to make my mac and cheese 
        (the way my family loves it too).</p>
