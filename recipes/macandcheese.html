    <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../images/macandcheese.jpeg" alt="Macoroni and Cheese">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Baked mac and cheese.  It’s nearly the universal comfort food, and there are SO many variations!  
        In fact, I almost didn’t post this recipe, as there are SOOOO many mac and cheese recipes available, 
        and most people already have their favorite way of making it.</p>
    <p>Of course, there’s no “right” way or “wrong” way, so I’m here sharing the way I like to make my mac and cheese 
        (the way my family loves it too).</p>    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups half and half</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded medium sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
        <li> 1/2 Tbsp. salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. paprika</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13"). </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  When boiling, add dried pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente.  
        Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.</li>
        <li>While water is coming up to a boil, shred cheeses and toss together to mix, then divide into three piles.
        Approximately 3 cups for the sauce, 1 1/2 cups for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat.  Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine.  Mixture will look like very wet sand.  Cook for approximately 1 minute, 
        whisking often.  Slowly pour in about 2 cups or so of the milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until smooth.  
        Slowly pour in the remaining milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a very thick consistency.  
        It should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned out condensed soup.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring to melt and combine.  
        Stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully.  
        Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top with 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheeses, 
        then top that with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, until cheesy is bubbly and lightly golden brown.</li>
